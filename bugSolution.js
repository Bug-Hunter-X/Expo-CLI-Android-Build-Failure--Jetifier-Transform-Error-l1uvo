The solution often involves identifying the conflicting library.  Check your `package.json` for dependencies that might not be compatible with AndroidX. You can try updating these libraries to their latest versions. If updating isn't possible or doesn't resolve the issue, you might need to find alternative libraries that have better AndroidX support.  In some cases, directly excluding the problematic library's transform using the `expo prebuild` command might work, but this isn't recommended as it can lead to instability.  If you're still stuck, carefully examine the complete error message provided by the Expo CLI, as it might pinpoint the exact library causing the conflict.
